# Datatypes
ALL of Loza variable datatypes system is handled by python. Python is a programming language Loza written with that.

### What is datatype
In the prevoius parts, you learned about **Variables**.

for example:

```bash
$name = 'hello'
$age = 15
$gender = False
# ...
```

**Value of variables has diffrent types.**

For example, Numbers, Strings(text), Boolean(True or False), Float...

This is table of all of datatypes:

|Name|Description|Example|
|----|-----------|-------|
|`str`|The string(text) is a list of characters|for example `"hello world"`, `'parsa'`... you should write them between `""` or `''`(not diffrent)|
|`int`|The integer numbers|`12`, `146433`...|
|`float`|The float numbers|`124.345`, `1.543657`...|
|`list`, `tuple`, `dict`|List of variables|Learn about them in next part [Arrays](06_arrays.md)
|`bool`|The `True` or `False`. This type is used in condition system|`True`, `False`

[You can see FULL Documentation of python datatypes in here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).

### null(None)
null or None is type of a value. They mean Empty.

for example:

```bash
$something = None
$something = null
```

The `None` and `null` keywords are Exactly like together and are not diffrent(`null` is a alias for `None`).
