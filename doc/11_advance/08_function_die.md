# Function `die()`
This function prints something and exits program.

For example:

```bash
die("Good bye")
```

Also you can use this without argument:

```bash
die()
```

By default, this function exits with `1` exit code. You can change exit code by passing second argument:

```bash
die("good bye", 100)
```
