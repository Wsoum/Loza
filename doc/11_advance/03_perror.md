# perror()
There is diffrent between normal print(print on STDOUT) and error print(print on STDERR). the `print` and `println` functions print on stdout(normal output). but you can print on STDERR using `perror` function. this is even `print`.

for example:

```bash
perror('hello world. this is a error and is printed on STDERR')
```
