# `$__file__` and `$__dir__` variables
`$__file__` and `$__dir__` variables are two variables contains self script filepath and dirpath.

for example, if you run an script in `/home/parsa/myscript.loza` with this content:

```bash
println($__file__)
println($__dir__)
```

output is:

```
/home/parsa/myscript.loza
/home/parsa
```

The `$__file__` variable contains filepath of current running script.

The `$__dir__` variable contains dirpath of current running script.
