# Internal Modules
loza has some internal libraries to use. that modules are helpful for you.

## how to import module
you can import modules with `import` function.

look at this example:

```bash
import '@hash'
import "@module_name"
import "@module1", '@module2'

# also you can import modules without quotes
import @sys
import @hash, @mymodule

# also you can import modules like scripts under the namespaces
namespace Foo
    import '@hash'
endns

# ...
```

you have to give name of module with a `@` before that to the include command.
